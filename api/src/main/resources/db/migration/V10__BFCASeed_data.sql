VALUES ('This would be handy for a person who knows very little about true microwave cooking. My wife has around 30 microwave cookbooks so it would be handy for her IF it had 1100 watts. It ought to be good for a person with messy hands, doing all kinds of things and they might just want to melt butter or something, not wanting to finger the microwave panel voice control would be handy, but it definitely needs 1100 watts for her more ambitious microwaving tasks.', '13');

VALUES ('Just used this feature this morning (to reheat dinner from last night). It connects with your Echo device (in my case, the Sonos 1 in my kitchen). You just close the door and say "Alex, cook for 3 minutes" and the microwave turns on. I guess it just cuts down on having to push buttons and for things like popcorn it knows how long to cook it for. Did that with coffee this morning: "Alexa, reheat my coffee" and it set for 1:20 minutes. This is a first generation, my hunch is it will get smarter with the types of food you put in it.', '13');

VALUES ('To actually answer the question, you can minimize the number of trips you take. Lets say youre with a group and have enough popcorn now but know youll want more halfway through your movie.... When you take the last bag out, put another in and go enjoy the movie... when youre ready for it tell Alexa and save yourself that extra trip to push the button. Simply go grab it when its ready. Another more likely situation would be a frozen food that needs 90 sec defrost then 40-50 seconds normal cooking. You can start and finish this whole process without returning to your microwave several times. Or when warming something with cheese. Where running it the full duration will end up in boiling cheese but cold food. You can run partial times without returning.', '13');

VALUES ('It doesnt NEED to be voice controlled, but think of it as an option. If youre cooking and your hands are dirty, you can voice control the microwave to stop it, add time, etc without touching it. Its still a normal basic microwave, but no longer do I look up how long to defrost 2.5 lbs of hamburger or set it for too much time and watch it so I can stop it. If youre going to spend $60 on a small microwave, this is a great one regardless of if you intend on using the voice controls.', '13');
